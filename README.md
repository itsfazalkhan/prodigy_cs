# Cybersecurity Intern Projects

## Description
Welcome to the Cybersecurity Intern Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of projects completed during my internship at Prodigy Infotech, focusing on various aspects of cybersecurity. Each project demonstrates my skills and knowledge in different areas of cybersecurity, from encryption techniques to network security tools.

## Project List
1. **Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption Program**: A Python program that implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm for text encryption and decryption. Users can input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

2. **Image Encryption Tool**: A tool developed using pixel manipulation techniques for encrypting and decrypting images. Users can perform operations like swapping pixel values or applying basic mathematical operations to each pixel.

3. **Password Strength Assessment Tool**: A tool that assesses the strength of passwords based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Users receive feedback on the password's strength.

4. **Basic Keylogger Program**: A Python program that records and logs keystrokes, focusing on ethical considerations and permissions. It logs the keys pressed and saves them to a file.

5. **Packet Sniffer Tool**: A packet sniffer tool that captures and analyzes network packets, displaying relevant information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data. Ethical use is emphasized for educational purposes.

## Usage
Each project is contained in its respective directory within the repository. Detailed instructions on how to use and run each project are provided in their individual README files within each directory.
